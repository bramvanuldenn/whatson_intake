# Write a program that loops through numbers one to 100.
#
# For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
# For multiples of five, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
# For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
# If none of these cases match, print the number.
